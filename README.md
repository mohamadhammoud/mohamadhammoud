## About Me 🙋‍♂️

I am passionate about exploring new technologies and building innovative solutions that can solve real-world problems. My expertise lies in building of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and blockchain-based protocols. I have a proven track record in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), including:

- Uniswap: Automated market-making and token swaps
- Compound: Decentralized lending and borrowing platforms
- MakerDAO: Stablecoin issuance and collateral management
  
In addition, I specialize in Real-World Asset (RWA) protocols and seamless Web3 integrations. My professional experience includes working with leading blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, where I have contributed to building scalable and impactful solutions.

I do have deep knowledge in Ethereum standards including ERC-4337 and contributed to some open source projects such as Biconomy, ensuring advanced solutions in Account Abstraction, in addition of writing some medium account abstraction articles.
